# SHA-256 Verilog Implementation

This repository contains a Verilog implementation of the SHA-256 cryptographic hashing algorithm, along with its testbench and simulation setup.

## Files Description

- `sha256.v` – Main Verilog module implementing the SHA-256 hashing logic.
- `test_sha256.py` – Cocotb-based Python testbench to verify the functionality of the SHA-256 module through simulation.
- `Makefile` – Makefile to automate the build and simulation process using Cocotb.
